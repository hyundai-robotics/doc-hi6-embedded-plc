# 2.3. Scan time

The time taken for the one-cycle execution of the ladder file in the embedded PLC will be indicated as “scan time” on the status bar at the bottom of the HRLadder. As the number of steps in the ladder program increases, the time for execution increases, slowing down the I/O responsiveness accordingly.
