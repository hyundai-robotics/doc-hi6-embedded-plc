# 3.1 The meaning of a relay

A device in a state equivalent to an on/off contact that determines whether to transfer an electrical signal is called a switch. Meanwhile, a relay is a switch that can operate automatically by using electricity rather than manually.  

Originally, a relay was a physical device that controls contacts using the magnetic force of a coil. However, a relay in a computerized programmable logic controller (PLC) is a logical concept that is controlled by software. In terms of the meaning, a relay has been used as a variable that can store not only an on/off state consisting of 1 bit but also a byte, word, double word, or real value consisting of several bits.
